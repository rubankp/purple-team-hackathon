0.0s  coming up on today's episode of the
2.52s  airdrive podcast very recently I visited
5.16s  a website they offered a full stack
6.96s  course for about what some 9 10 11
9.72s  months that course teaches you Java
12.0s  python react and flutter I guess and
15.299s  some other web development one of those
17.22s  these things were optional and again the
19.8s  course was pitched to people who are not
21.66s  from Tech background and the course
23.52s  price was somewhere in the range of 2.53
27.24s  lakhs rupees this is total scam it is
30.24s  outright scam I would say
36.42s  welcome to the fourth episode of the
38.34s  airtry podcast in today's episode we're
41.1s  going to talk about why people hate edx
43.379s  so dhaval what are we discussing today
45.42s  let's discuss this Universal hate at
48.12s  tech companies get from everybody
50.879s  for various different reasons so why do
52.92s  you think a tech companies get so much
54.78s  hate a lot of reasons but I think one
58.079s  major reason is the whole term ad Tech a
61.079s  lot of companies end up prioritizing
63.0s  Tech over education like even though I'm
66.0s  a tech co-founder but I strongly believe
68.1s  that education part is lot more
70.08s  important in an attack company
71.88s  Tech should be the enabler but a lot of
75.659s  attacks just focus on creating Superior
78.659s  Tech and they compromise on the
80.28s  education quality altogether
82.799s  I think that that's one major reason but
85.799s  obviously there are few others I want to
87.18s  talk about but do you want to share some
89.34s  anything else before I go there I wanted
91.14s  to like I'm curious now uh if you are
94.2s  saying many attack companies prioritize
96.299s  Tech over education
98.88s  what could be the reason for that I'm
101.04s  not sure I mean it all started with
103.2s  whole um
104.46s  moocs um
106.619s  massively open online courses
109.68s  um
110.28s  with that whole Revolution uh I actually
113.22s  like all of those platforms right and
114.899s  they made sure that everybody and
117.119s  anybody can have access to really high
118.92s  quality education uh at a very very
121.38s  cheap cost but then what followed after
124.68s  that um
126.119s  like people wanted to scale education
128.52s  but inherently I feel that
131.22s  moocs could scale but they also
133.8s  compromised on other factors like
135.36s  quality of Education was great but other
137.879s  factors you need on with education uh
140.7s  like we are learning mentorship
143.84s  guidance from an instructor or from a
147.06s  mentor all of those things are you
148.8s  building soft skills all of those things
150.599s  are not there uh when we talk about such
153.239s  platforms so it again like you know I'm
156.42s  not sure like you know it probably
158.22s  the kind of funding they receive or the
160.14s  VCS uh behind them there'll be a lot of
163.98s  pressure for them to grow at all cost
167.12s  and uh that would have compromised the
170.34s  education part for sure because that
172.019s  would have been the easiest thing to
173.64s  compromise on why you said they were
176.16s  able to give quality education but uh
178.92s  not probably giving a great experience
181.739s  in terms of mentorship or peer learning
183.84s  and all that in my view great education
186.06s  must include all of these yeah so
189.36s  I think I should connect myself then
191.459s  then it's not great education
193.5s  I would say it's great content so they
196.019s  were able to generate really high
197.58s  quality content out there from like
199.8s  somebody who is in USA who is that one
203.099s  person who knows about something about
205.8s  machine learning and I get to learn from
207.78s  it it might not be possible for me to go
210.12s  to USA and then learn from him but
211.92s  because of that uh moocs system
215.04s  available and multiple platforms are
217.379s  there because of that I get the access
218.879s  to that content so yeah I mean it's not
221.34s  the education part but more on the
223.2s  content side got it so one of those
225.84s  platforms is Coursera and Coursera is a
229.68s  very very good platform for high quality
231.78s  education very interestingly it was
233.819s  called mlclass.org before you know
236.64s  before the name was even given and it
239.4s  was 2012 I was still in college and
242.22s  Android NG one of the professors at
243.959s  Stanford he did this experiment what if
246.659s  he opened up the class to people outside
248.64s  of Stanford would people be interested
251.36s  and uh
253.26s  thousands of people actually showed
254.819s  interest I was one of them and they took
257.82s  the class A small percent of them
259.739s  actually completed the class and they
261.6s  started working on projects and they
263.16s  started putting their code on GitHub and
265.5s  elsewhere
266.699s  it gave him the signal that something
269.28s  like this might work it led to even more
272.1s  professors and subject matter experts at
274.74s  top universities from Stanford MIT
277.86s  Princeton putting very high quality
280.44s  programs on the internet but like you
282.78s  said the quality here was more on the
285.24s  content side
286.62s  not necessarily on things that really
289.199s  matters in offline
291.3s  classroom which is engagement which is
294.18s  attention to
295.919s  to the students that collaboration that
298.44s  happens when people come together who
300.66s  work in projects together and build
302.82s  interpersonal skills all those things
304.62s  were missing also I guess the hate
306.68s  towards these platform is still minimal
309.66s  I would say uh but the kind of hate we
312.06s  we see specifically for Indian startups
316.139s  I don't want to name them right now uh
318.3s  but we we see a huge
321.259s  discomfort in the audience or they just
323.88s  don't like talking about them they just
325.86s  believe that these guys are scamming
327.3s  people left right and Center uh there
330.419s  are various reasons let's talk about
331.86s  them very interesting uh what could be
335.22s  the difference then initially you said
336.6s  at Tech universally gets a lot of hate
339.18s  now you are saying it's a lot more
341.759s  pronounced in the case of Indian
343.38s  startups does it have something to do
345.72s  with the way some companies operate here
348.479s  or is it related to the overall
350.94s  psychology of uh the country itself you
354.3s  know how we respond to massive success
356.759s  stories because
358.02s  in my view nobody cared about attack
360.84s  until 2020. in 2020
364.919s  when the covet pandemic started at tech
368.1s  companies which were building behind the
369.84s  scenes hardly getting any attention from
372.12s  the investors they started raising
374.1s  hundreds of millions of dollars
376.08s  and they grew faster than every other
378.12s  industry during that period
380.039s  there was a huge bet everyone thought
382.759s  the future of education is going to be
385.199s  fully online and I think many companies
388.86s  benefited from that or everyone joined
391.8s  the bandwagon as it turns out everyone
393.96s  was over optimistic about uh the change
397.62s  in behavior of students learning online
400.38s  they thought it was going to be long
402.539s  term but most people went back to
404.699s  offline education after the pandemic got
406.919s  over I think it was a maybe a time for
412.259s  uh you know a lot of people to say
414.3s  things about attack because it was
416.58s  growing really really fast and then it
419.1s  stopped growing and people started
421.139s  attributing you know the fall to
422.94s  multiple reasons not just the change in
425.28s  user Behavior which is much harder to
426.96s  understand and uh much harder to you
429.72s  know build Solutions around but I guess
431.699s  there was some hate even before pandemic
435.06s  started we had companies in India and
437.94s  there was a lot of bad mouthing about
439.56s  those companies why do you think so in
441.479s  the primary reason is
443.039s  um
443.58s  a lot of misselling happening at that
445.319s  company
446.22s  they over promise and under deliver
449.16s  multiple reasons again behind that like
451.319s  probably the salesperson who is that uh
455.4s  he has he's under immense pressure he is
458.22s  doing whatever it takes to sell that
459.96s  particular course or module or whatever
462.36s  it is obviously if that's not being
464.699s  delivered via the course via the attack
467.22s  company uh the person who bought the
470.039s  course they are they're not going to be
471.72s  happy about it
473.099s  right so that that's one major reason
475.319s  second thing is this whole like in your
479.46s  customer and the person who are you are
482.46s  selling it to those two are different
483.96s  personas here you're selling it to
486.06s  parents but your actual customer is like
488.4s  if you talk about K-12 and kids
489.9s  education your customer is a kid
492.3s  but you're selling it to parents
494.52s  now it this is where things become very
496.86s  very tricky right kid may or may not
499.68s  want to
500.52s  use your product may or may not like a
502.5s  product uh but the parents you need to
505.86s  show them different dreams about your
508.259s  kid being successful and what not and I
510.9s  don't want to even get into those World
512.279s  Cup and all of those cases
514.86s  um but yeah I mean we have heard about
517.14s  those stories and seen what has happened
519.599s  so I think it's the primary reason is
522.479s  like you know the root cause is they
525.42s  promising a lot of stuff and not being
528.06s  able to deliver is the root of olive oil
530.82s  I would say got it there is one thing I
533.279s  can you know talk about from my
535.08s  experience when I talk about over
536.459s  promise under deliver I think one of the
538.74s  biggest differences I have seen
542.04s  um from my time in the US versus India
544.32s  when it comes to attack companies very
547.14s  interestingly many of the original mooc
549.36s  platforms started in the US but some of
551.7s  the largest edtech companies in the
552.959s  world are actually now based in India
555.0s  are mostly propelled by over optimism
557.279s  around around time you know Kobe was
560.7s  there and you know everyone was
562.98s  um embedding on at tech companies in
565.2s  India I have seen lots of companies
566.94s  saying you know you do our course and
569.16s  you will get a placement guarantee 100
571.14s  placement guarantee this is not
573.18s  something I have seen elsewhere
575.04s  yeah and uh I think it has a lot to do
578.04s  with the overall
580.5s  aspiration of the Indian youth I think
584.76s  you know there is so much of hunger in
586.38s  the country so much of competition in
588.36s  the country uh everyone wants to like
590.82s  you know
591.72s  be part of that one person who makes it
594.06s  like they say in sales either you sell
597.12s  hope or you sell fear and I think many
600.36s  companies took the path of selling fear
602.64s  instead of hope both Works in some cases
605.76s  but lots of people join these programs
609.48s  because they were afraid
611.1s  if they don't join they don't upskill
613.26s  themselves
614.22s  I think lots of people were promised job
616.92s  guarantee programs unlike top
618.72s  universities whether India or elsewhere
621.3s  in the world
622.44s  these programs didn't have such high
625.56s  selection criteria
627.48s  so anyone could join either they had the
631.08s  money or their parents had the money or
633.6s  Banks had the money to give them Emi
635.339s  options and like you know loans
638.04s  all these people joined the programs
639.72s  somehow because they wanted job
641.64s  guarantees it's next to Impossible
644.42s  guarantee a job
646.38s  particularly in such a tight job market
649.38s  and I think lots of people who went to
651.36s  the experience they started bad mouthing
653.579s  the industry and their experience and
655.68s  the word of mouth eventually became
657.959s  quite negative particularly around job
660.0s  guarantee programs and I guess it's not
661.92s  just because of the current economic
664.56s  situation even without that like I don't
667.74s  even see any good IIT I am giving like
670.62s  they do share their stats that okay
672.66s  there was 100 placement but when you
674.7s  take an admission they definitely not
677.399s  guarantee you that once you are enrolled
679.92s  in a program you'll get 100 like you'll
681.959s  get the job 100 for sure they don't do
684.0s  that and I'm sure there is a reason
685.74s  behind that because they also know that
687.06s  it's
688.079s  common sense right I mean it's very hard
690.6s  for you to get a job
693.36s  without working hard for in that program
695.22s  without performing really well in that
697.56s  program you need to do the hard work
699.6s  without that it's just impossible for
701.399s  you to get a job you can't just pay for
703.2s  a program and expect that okay after
705.66s  eight nine ten months uh I'll graduate
708.18s  to the job that's not possible there are
710.339s  definitely lots of students out there
711.899s  who would want
713.279s  to get into the program somehow but not
716.82s  necessarily you know work hard to get
718.44s  what you know get the role I usually
720.54s  don't talk about other companies or the
723.0s  startups or um
725.16s  other other competitors of ours in this
728.22s  space I actually admire them most of
730.079s  them actually very recently I visited a
732.0s  website
733.079s  they offer a full stack course for about
735.779s  what some nine ten eleven months that
738.899s  course teaches you Java
741.0s  python
742.44s  react and flutter I guess and some other
746.1s  app development and like one of one of
748.079s  those these things were optional and
750.12s  again the course was pitched to people
751.76s  who are not from Tech background and the
754.74s  course price was somewhere in the range
757.38s  of 2.53 lakhs rupees this is total scam
760.74s  it is outright scam I would say first of
763.56s  all if somebody is coming from a
765.24s  non-tech background they don't need to
767.04s  learn all of those things the first even
770.279s  before they get the job they don't need
772.019s  to go through all of these things
773.639s  they need to probably figure out one
775.32s  single area either get into front end or
777.54s  get into app development or get into
779.1s  back-end development just do one thing
781.079s  and do it really very well and then
782.7s  figure out what you want to do
784.44s  but then this course which is I'm sure
786.48s  it is being sold to people
788.82s  who do not even understand
790.56s  um
791.399s  Tech very very well who do not even know
793.56s  what's the future scope looking like all
796.38s  they want to do is that okay they want
797.579s  to get into Tech and this course might
799.68s  be helping
800.94s  some people but
802.56s  I I highly doubt that there are any out
805.079s  possible outcomes from this course how
807.72s  can you even charge uh so much money and
811.079s  just stuff every random possible thing
813.839s  around engineering and uh
817.32s  like just make sure that because of you
819.42s  have all of those keywords in your
820.92s  program you can charge more and more
823.38s  not just this the if you scroll down on
826.86s  that page and you go to the instructor
828.6s  section
830.519s  you know somebody who has again nothing
833.04s  against that person uh first of all
835.92s  with that person is not in the industry
838.92s  that person graduated some 25 30 years
841.38s  back they are not working professional
844.079s  they are probably teaching at some
845.339s  college if they are teaching react.js I
848.279s  really want to know what reactors they
850.86s  are teaching right now
852.48s  because there's there's so hands off
854.88s  right now
855.959s  they don't even
857.94s  know what's the latest Trend in the
860.76s  industry right now I'm not sure like
862.5s  what kind of uh delivery they would be
864.72s  doing what kind of uh stuff they would
867.12s  be teaching in their program probably
868.5s  sales I don't know but um this this like
872.399s  this is not even miss selling or
873.959s  anything like that this is outright scam
876.24s  I would say but I can bet there is a
878.76s  market for this like we say features
880.74s  versus benefits in products maybe they
884.88s  took the path of like you know talking a
886.38s  lot about the features that they have
887.82s  and uh that is definitely a market uh
891.6s  where some students are looking to learn
893.279s  all of this because they think it will
895.26s  help them get a job uh but it couldn't
898.199s  be for you know any further from truth
900.0s  absolutely it's kind of unfortunate but
902.639s  uh you know I have seen this happening
904.98s  uh with multiple other attack platforms
908.459s  you know because of this the whole at
910.56s  tech industry gets the Heat
912.959s  like when somebody goes to the program
915.54s  they don't get the outcomes obviously
917.579s  they are not going to get the outcomes
919.139s  uh by going through such program then
921.24s  they lose the whole faith on online
922.74s  education on any certain uh other player
926.22s  out there I guess it's just uh damages
929.16s  the whole industry altogether like that
931.5s  one player or such players doing such
934.56s  practice bad practices right it it's
937.44s  really short term good for them but uh
939.6s  in the long term I think it's damaging
941.16s  the whole industry let's take a step
942.959s  back
943.74s  and uh think about
945.959s  how universities work their impact on
948.54s  students let's talk about India there
951.72s  may be not more than 20 30
954.44s  bid colleges for engineering education
957.24s  for example there are lots of tier two
959.399s  tier three colleges if you talk about
961.199s  any tier three College they also
963.3s  probably you know uh promise a lot to
966.06s  the students because they need to get
967.56s  them admitted uh into the programs but
970.38s  they end up not delivering
972.6s  going by what you are saying that should
975.12s  affect the overall
977.04s  value of engineering education but uh
979.32s  has it and they do deliver degree even
981.66s  if it carries value or not but they
983.76s  still get you the degree which is
986.88s  we like it or not but that's the
988.62s  unfortunate reality that degrees do
990.899s  matter but they still matter uh in the
993.66s  world of uh startups where so many
995.399s  Founders on Twitter they talk about uh
997.259s  we value skills uh over your degrees we
1000.86s  don't even care which college you went
1002.36s  to as long as you have the right set of
1006.38s  skills and you do well in the interviews
1009.259s  and if the question is do they matter to
1012.259s  me or the starter Founders I don't think
1015.079s  the answer is yes they don't matter but
1018.44s  he says that like you know if you talk
1020.42s  about when you're taking the admission
1021.92s  in a uh in any such College you're
1024.559s  definitely not thinking about a startup
1026.179s  founder who will get give you a job yeah
1028.459s  it's your parents who are deciding for
1030.679s  you and they definitely do not know
1032.12s  what's happening in the industry right
1033.38s  now they're definitely far far away from
1036.799s  what are the expectations companies will
1039.559s  have
1040.64s  so there I think there is a lot of
1042.799s  influence from the parent side
1046.16s  and um second thing is
1049.52s  I still feel that the whole college
1051.74s  experience is valuable
1053.6s  as long as you go from you graduate from
1055.94s  a good college
1057.08s  I still don't tell you the degree as
1059.84s  such but the college experience is still
1061.82s  valuable I would not say that any Tech
1064.22s  startup should go ahead and just replace
1065.84s  b-tech education out there and they can
1068.12s  easily do that the whole offline
1069.679s  experience what you do get to uh learn
1073.039s  for an example
1074.36s  um in a hostel uh
1077.36s  on top of the Core Curriculum you get to
1079.7s  learn a lot of new things on top of the
1082.52s  Core Curriculum you get to network
1085.28s  those things are there available in like
1087.98s  all good colleges will provide you with
1089.539s  that but any quality here two three
1092.539s  callers I don't think you get any of
1094.46s  this so you talked about the benefits of
1096.26s  offline education like you know uh they
1098.179s  get to build uh a lot more skills not
1101.24s  just the Core Curriculum that they go
1103.28s  through I think when I was in college I
1105.32s  saw lots of people participating in in
1107.539s  college fests uh there were you know
1109.94s  lots of college clubs where they could
1111.5s  join to build specific skills in machine
1113.6s  learning AI or robotics or uh you know
1117.14s  if they wanted to experiment with uh
1119.0s  building a car for that matter from
1121.28s  scratch there were also you know
1123.32s  different clubs for dance music
1126.38s  um and all you know all these
1127.58s  extracurricular activities I think all
1129.14s  of that helps people you know helps the
1131.9s  students to build a whole personality
1134.72s  and discover their interests and also
1137.36s  become a little more multifaceted which
1140.059s  definitely helps during the interviews
1141.799s  uh nobody wants to hire uh someone
1144.5s  without
1145.539s  perspectives and not just interviews I
1147.919s  would say it helps in life
1149.9s  that's true yeah you talked about a
1152.0s  teacher uh teaching react.js but has
1155.419s  like you know uh 23 years of experience
1158.0s  and probably not exposed to what is
1160.34s  going on at The Cutting Edge of
1161.9s  Technology at this point of time
1163.059s  react.js is still relatively new I think
1165.799s  you would expect someone with written
1167.539s  recent experience in the industry to
1169.28s  teach it yeah but when I think about
1171.62s  college education uh there also
1174.799s  you you learn from professors who have
1177.32s  been teaching for 20 30 years and uh
1180.14s  many of them are not exposed to what's
1182.059s  happening in the industry one more thing
1183.799s  about education is that it's not just
1186.26s  content download from the instructor to
1189.44s  the learner
1190.76s  right
1191.84s  um
1192.44s  so sticking another story I was taking
1194.84s  an interview of a lady for one of the
1197.36s  roles we had opened and she told me that
1200.179s  um
1200.9s  on their platform again she was working
1202.94s  at another attack company they don't
1204.44s  allow people to unmute in the live
1206.12s  session live sessions were happening on
1207.86s  Zoom so it was just a one-way delivery
1210.2s  from the instructor or they would call a
1212.419s  trainer trainer to uh the Learners and
1216.98s  uh
1217.88s  I was thinking what's the point of
1219.38s  anybody joining a live session like that
1221.66s  if it is going to be
1223.52s  a one-way delivery you would rather
1225.679s  watch a YouTube video which is very very
1228.14s  well short which is uh there's somebody
1230.84s  who has actually prepared content for
1232.94s  those five 10 20 30 minutes of content
1235.4s  which is very very well prepared you
1237.08s  would rather watch that then join a
1239.299s  session where you again it's like a
1240.679s  Netflix mode
1242.36s  um you just watch and try to understand
1244.82s  uh whatever you can but the problem is
1247.22s  that education is not just about content
1249.62s  download it's also about mentoring it's
1252.2s  also about inspiring
1254.12s  people it's also about giving them a
1256.58s  safe space where they can open up they
1258.799s  can be vulnerable
1260.36s  but I think all of these attacks again
1263.78s  I'm I'm guessing the reason behind that
1266.6s  is skill
1268.16s  they wanted to scale and they had to put
1270.32s  in a lot of standardization but again it
1272.48s  everything came at the cost of Education
1275.48s  high quality education
1277.16s  and now I think and because of that the
1280.82s  outcomes are not great and uh the kind
1284.24s  of quality of people who graduate from
1286.28s  the program I think that also I don't
1288.86s  think
1290.0s  the quality will be that great so like
1291.98s  you said there is definitely some
1293.72s  tension between
1294.98s  scale and quality
1297.799s  and I think a lot of companies
1301.179s  in this space they over optimized for
1303.98s  scale and not enough for quality
1308.299s  and I think it also has a lot to do with
1311.0s  who gets to raise funding it's a
1313.28s  different tangent to talk about but I
1314.78s  still wanted to bring it up because it's
1316.1s  very important to our conversation today
1318.559s  which is tech companies get a lot higher
1321.2s  valuation than traditional companies and
1324.5s  I think everyone wanted to raise Capital
1327.38s  to grow faster and uh
1330.799s  that pitch around Tech the the pitch
1333.38s  around
1334.7s  scalability was very very important
1336.88s  probably What affected uh
1340.22s  the quality on some of these platforms
1342.86s  having said that
1344.299s  I think there is good news uh I have
1347.6s  seen and I am surprised by
1350.84s  what I would call the third generation
1352.4s  of actor companies in India they are all
1355.1s  around communities they are all around
1356.6s  mentorship where the focus is on
1359.059s  increasing participation from
1360.679s  instructors mentors Learners uh in these
1363.559s  programs the focus is on driving
1366.02s  dialogue as part of the life sessions
1367.76s  instead of
1369.14s  uh content delivery and downloads
1372.02s  there are many such platforms Air Drive
1374.0s  is just one of them we are not the only
1375.74s  one doing it that's good news for the
1377.48s  learners
1378.5s  the more options they have in the market
1380.179s  the better quality we will be able to
1382.039s  deliver eventually because competition
1384.14s  definitely drives better quality
1385.84s  absolutely yeah and these platforms do
1389.0s  look class apart than the
1392.0s  traditional edtech companies out there
1394.159s  in the market and if I were to name them
1396.32s  like let's say if you talk about growth
1398.419s  hacks if you talk about 10K designers if
1401.12s  you talk about stowa
1402.799s  all of these programs look class apart
1405.32s  than the other attack players other
1408.26s  giant that Tech players out there in the
1409.94s  market even their websites look very
1411.559s  different yeah people say the same thing
1413.9s  about our website
1415.28s  but it's very interesting if you go to
1417.44s  the websites of any of these players
1419.12s  that we you know just named they look a
1421.7s  lot more focused on people in community
1424.059s  communities driving conversations and
1427.4s  they all talk about uh outcomes but uh
1431.299s  they never undervalue the effort and the
1434.48s  time it takes for a learner to reach the
1436.7s  outcomes
1437.539s  very interestingly all these companies
1439.4s  do not fit the category of hyper growth
1441.62s  companies at this point of time but my
1444.5s  belief is this is probably the right
1446.36s  approach all of them are building the
1448.52s  fundamental building blocks of the next
1451.22s  generation of attack companies and once
1454.159s  they hit the infection point I think all
1456.44s  of them will start growing rapidly from
1458.36s  there yeah and the Parallels for that
1462.44s  would be how communities like
1464.6s  Reddit and coragrio they started small
1467.96s  they took years to reach critical mass
1470.0s  before they started exploring in
1472.7s  popularity both of us had very short
1475.4s  stint at an academy I guess six and nine
1477.86s  months respectively let's talk about an
1480.08s  academy what are the views on an academy
1483.2s  going offline that's a tough one but I
1486.32s  will try an academy going offline at
1488.539s  this scale is a clear indicator students
1491.74s  loved offline learning I think everyone
1495.62s  in the ecosystem overblue the impact of
1499.1s  covet and how students are going to
1501.919s  learn in the future as it turns out an
1504.62s  academy saw
1505.88s  all these offline players like akas
1507.98s  Institute and others doing so much
1510.5s  better than them
1512.059s  post covered and I think they had a
1516.02s  decision to make either continue the
1518.24s  same Journey with their core test prep
1521.059s  product and keep losing subscribers or
1524.12s  take the hard decision and do what they
1527.0s  never wanted to do yeah I think the
1529.64s  whole company started because they
1531.5s  wanted to bring
1532.88s  offline coaching online yeah I actually
1536.0s  applaud the Bold move that they took by
1539.0s  going all in on offline because that's
1541.82s  exactly what they originally wanted to
1544.1s  disrupt yeah but when it comes to
1546.74s  startups and success of startups long
1549.08s  term either you disrupt or you get
1551.12s  disrupted and to survive in the face of
1555.86s  most of their other products not working
1558.74s  out
1559.76s  they had to ensure that their core test
1562.88s  prep product continues to do well and
1565.64s  the only legit path
1567.559s  I guess they had going forward was to
1570.44s  open these offline centers back to back
1572.6s  and based on what I know I think that
1576.08s  business is doing really well now and uh
1579.02s  because of which they might be able to
1581.48s  figure out other products other
1583.64s  sustainable business models uh you know
1586.159s  in the near future
1587.659s  but it says something really really big
1590.779s  about uh how the attic in India has
1593.48s  evolved one important thing to
1595.88s  understand here is much of their
1597.74s  disruption in attack post covet has been
1600.86s  in
1601.82s  kids education
1603.44s  or K-12 or test prep but when it comes
1606.5s  to professional upskilling courses which
1609.08s  platforms like upgrade and others focus
1611.299s  on including air Drive we haven't seen
1613.82s  much impact yeah I think the reversal of
1617.419s  kovid hasn't impacted much only the one
1620.36s  thing which we do feel is uh time
1624.98s  earlier people had a lot of time they
1626.9s  were not going to office and uh
1630.98s  we had the flexibility of scheduling
1632.9s  sessions at multiple different times now
1636.62s  I think we are losing that flexibility
1638.26s  but overall I mean on the business side
1641.779s  it's just growing uh
1644.24s  and there is solid reason behind that
1646.039s  right it's very easy to get a good
1648.62s  English teacher in your locality it's
1650.779s  very easy to get a good match teacher in
1652.64s  your locality but
1654.08s  I don't think it's that easy to get a
1656.179s  good node.js react or database expert in
1659.539s  your locality
1660.679s  and the kind of audience we are talking
1664.1s  about here which is maybe they are
1665.9s  working professionals I don't think they
1667.46s  even want to go to an offline coaching
1670.279s  Center anymore
1671.779s  um
1672.62s  and want to learn from somebody who is
1675.559s  not the best in the industry right now
1677.12s  these people definitely want to learn
1678.799s  from an expert they would definitely
1680.419s  want to learn from somebody who is day
1682.46s  in day out practicing these skills I
1684.08s  would not discard the offline education
1685.64s  setup as well though
1687.46s  McMasters Union is a very solid example
1690.02s  right and they are getting the best
1692.14s  industry experts out there
1694.7s  from various different places uh flying
1697.52s  into their facility and driving those
1700.94s  programs and I think that program is the
1703.279s  core program is getting really good
1705.559s  feedback from the industry from the
1708.2s  Learners and they're also able to drive
1709.82s  you very solid outcomes
1711.5s  yeah one more reason attack gets a lot
1714.02s  of it is also because people think that
1716.72s  um education has to be free similar to
1719.48s  what they believe for
1721.22s  Healthcare as well I guess where they
1723.5s  feel that Healthcare education and
1726.2s  everything is a basic necessity and it
1728.6s  has to be free
1729.679s  what are your views on that I don't
1731.419s  think so why
1733.039s  because it pays the bills for all of us
1735.7s  that's true
1737.72s  but uh on a serious note
1740.299s  I remember the origin story of Google
1742.4s  when
1744.08s  Larry Page wrote one of his biggest
1747.26s  learnings in life was
1749.12s  to drive impact you have to be
1751.36s  self-sustainable and uh
1754.52s  I have long believed
1756.679s  if you really want to drive impact
1759.5s  at scale we have to find a business
1761.96s  model that actually pays the bills
1765.2s  so that everyone has enough time and
1767.72s  motivation to drive impact and I'm
1769.88s  talking at the company level
1771.559s  but when you think from learner's point
1773.299s  of view
1774.26s  I very strongly believe they have to
1777.14s  have skill in the game just like when
1779.299s  they go for good college in India people
1782.48s  end up paying uh 6 to 10 lakhs for a
1785.779s  good b-tech education but when it comes
1788.24s  to us people end up paying hundreds of
1791.659s  thousands of dollars
1792.98s  they put skin in the game
1794.96s  and they work hard with the hope that
1798.14s  they will get an outcome and most people
1799.64s  end up getting an outcome if they go to
1801.86s  good college and they work hard
1803.899s  the same has to be applicable in online
1806.6s  education
1807.74s  that's what I believe having said that
1810.86s  I also believe
1812.36s  for people like us who come with a tech
1814.52s  background and want to create impact
1817.399s  with
1819.32s  attack I think it's important for us to
1822.14s  also understand that we have a strong
1824.84s  responsibility to figure out ways to
1827.36s  make it more accessible and more
1829.1s  affordable and not just for Learners
1831.08s  right even for our instructors and
1833.12s  mentors so if you're paying them which
1836.12s  is something we can only do if we are
1838.279s  charging our learners if you're paying
1840.38s  our instructors and mentors we can also
1842.0s  keep them accountable we can control the
1844.58s  quality of the education
1846.38s  they'll also be motivated enough to
1847.88s  deliver their best and it makes sense
1849.74s  because the time of this mentors and
1851.84s  instructors who are you know industry
1854.059s  practice nurse and who are paid really
1856.82s  well in their full-time jobs they have
1859.64s  to be
1860.96s  rewarded for their time and effort yep
1863.12s  on these platforms otherwise what
1865.399s  incentive would they have apart from
1867.32s  giving back to the community you know to
1869.36s  keep coming back for these courses
1872.6s  it sounds nice to you know
1875.299s  here many people are willing to give
1877.64s  back to the community but I think uh at
1880.279s  the end of the day everyone values their
1882.799s  time yeah true one more reason there is
1885.74s  a lot of hate about attack is because
1888.74s  people think that there is not much
1890.779s  Innovation here they feel that whatever
1892.34s  is working in offline they just moved it
1895.22s  to online setup and they try to scale it
1897.44s  with the help of Technology but I guess
1899.419s  there is also a problem with our
1901.46s  education system the current education
1903.559s  system is up
1905.0s  it is designed to produce
1907.7s  obedient workers but it is not designed
1910.64s  to produce critical thinkers
1912.62s  the whole system around grading
1915.919s  test
1917.299s  and everything
1918.86s  it doesn't really test the knowledge it
1922.039s  probably tests the memory part and I
1924.26s  don't think that's a good way
1925.76s  of judging anybody
1928.82s  but that's how the whole education
1930.559s  system is designed and ethics
1932.84s  not all but most of the ethics are not
1934.82s  trying to redefine that
1936.559s  they are just trying to build so that
1938.419s  okay you can get good grades they are
1940.22s  just trying to optimize for that and
1941.539s  they are not trying to rethink the whole
1943.52s  education part and that's also where I
1945.98s  feel that there is lot of it coming in
1947.6s  for education online education that
1950.0s  because they have the technology power
1951.44s  they could probably just think the
1953.48s  education from grounds up and rethink
1956.24s  the whole new model but that's
1958.52s  definitely not happening right now it
1960.2s  will be much much harder to think from
1961.7s  the ground up and uh part of the reason
1964.82s  for that is most at the companies are
1967.88s  started by people in Tech
1969.679s  not by people in education education
1972.5s  reformists think very differently they
1974.84s  come out with uh new ways of learning
1977.48s  and teaching there is a philosophy there
1979.88s  is a framework that they have developed
1982.1s  over the years but that's not how all
1984.86s  these attack companies get started their
1987.32s  strength is technology not understanding
1989.659s  the nitty-gritty of how people really
1991.52s  learn
1992.48s  and doing that is the harder part that's
1995.419s  why I think some of my favorite attack
1997.94s  companies around the world I can talk
2000.34s  about one example here by the way have
2002.2s  you heard of this interesting startup in
2003.58s  the U.S called synthesis yeah I was
2006.64s  following them on Twitter they were
2008.559s  making a lot of noise on Twitter I think
2010.059s  during the pandemic but uh the core idea
2013.539s  is very fascinating it talks about uh
2016.299s  getting lots of you know uh kids to
2020.2s  participate in games games designed to
2023.98s  build their critical skills build their
2026.559s  collaboration skills and it was
2028.899s  originally started as an experiment at
2031.179s  SpaceX supposed to help families of
2035.74s  employees working at SpaceX they
2038.32s  recently opened up to the wider world so
2040.72s  I do think there are some companies
2042.519s  which took a very different route like
2045.1s  this one but they tend to grow really
2047.32s  slowly in the beginning
2048.94s  and uh I think education is one of those
2051.94s  areas where it takes time to validate
2055.48s  your core hypothesis
2057.04s  around an Innovative approach and uh
2060.46s  Founders the leaders have to be patient
2062.7s  yep instead of taking the shortcuts
2066.04s  because creating impact always takes
2068.74s  time
2069.76s  and it's hard yeah anything worth doing
2072.22s  is hard and with that we come to the end
2074.56s  of this episode I hope you enjoyed we'll
2076.78s  see you in the next one
